0.97 was the last stable release of [Sanselan](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-imaging/download_sanselan.cgi), a library that reads and writes a variety of image formats, including fast parsing of image info (size, color space, ICC profile, etc.) and metadata. Sanselan has since been swallowed up and is now part of [Apache Commons Imaging](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-imaging/).

It is necessary to maintain `sanselan-android` because there are modifications and re-definitions necessary to enable Sanselan to work correctly on Android (plug: [read our post](http://www.fulcrumapp.com/blog/adding-photo-quality-settings-on-android/)). Additionally, there isn't currently a stable release of Apache Commons Imaging (especially one with the aforementioned tweaks).
